# EviteSystem

This program is an internal invite system that allows for users to register their emails to become Host users. Hosts can:
- Plan parties
- Create guest lists
- Check the status of their planned parties

Guests are non-registered users who can:
- RSVP to parties
- Notify what they are bringing to parties

This was a fun project in Java that was a great exploration into Java and OOP principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, and data structures.
